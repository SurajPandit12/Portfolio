                            <p className='text-md lg:text-l leading-8 pb-2 text-justify'>Hello! I'm Suraj Pandit, a dedicated and passionate individual currently pursuing my Bachelor of Information Management (BIM) at Nepal Commerce Campus. I'm in my final semester, delving deep into subjects like information systems, management, and software development, which align perfectly with my career aspirations in the tech industry.

My journey in technology has been enriched by practical experiences and active involvement in various roles. Currently, I'm interning at Nest Nepal as a front-end developer, where I contribute to building intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. This role allows me to combine my technical skills with creativity, enhancing user experiences and fostering engagement.

Beyond academics and professional engagements, I have a strong inclination towards community service. My time as a volunteer with Nepal Scout has been profoundly rewarding. I have actively participated in organizing events, assisting in training programs, and contributing to community development initiatives. This experience has honed my leadership skills and deepened my commitment to making a positive impact on society. </p>

                            <p className='text-md lg:text-l leading-8'>Recently, I have embarked on a new learning journey with Next.js, which has opened up new possibilities for building robust and scalable web applications. This continuous learning mindset drives my passion for technology and innovation.</p>
